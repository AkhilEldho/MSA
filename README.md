## Key Tools
- Git: For version control i.e. keeping track of any changes you make to your code
- Visual Studio (VS) Code: A code editor for any language
- GitHub Desktop: A graphical user interface (GUI) for Git
  - Note: If you are new to Git and not familiar with command line arguments, feel free to use this GUI for version control instead
- Node.js: For backend web development
  - After downloading Node.js, please complete this tutorial to set up VS Code: [Node.js in VS Code](#)
  - Note: The Node.js Package Manager (npm) is also installed with Node.js, which allows you to use code created by other developers in your own code
- React: For frontend web development
  - After downloading React, please complete this tutorial to set up VS Code: [React in VS Code](#)
  - Note: You do not need to download anything else if you have downloaded Node.js, but we recommend you follow the steps in the React link above to ensure everything is working correctly
- Visual Studio Community: An integrated developer environment (IDE) for the C# language
- .NET 8: A framework for developing C# applications
