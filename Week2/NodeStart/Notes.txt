Javascript is a runtime language

Synchronous operations versus asynchronous operations
The Node.js APIs provide for both asynchronous and synchronous operations for some of the same operations such as file operations. 
While generally you should always think asynchronous-first, there are times when you might use synchronous operations.

An example is when a command line interface (CLI) reads a file and then immediately uses the data in the file. 
In this case, you can use the synchronous version of the file operation because there's no other system or person waiting to use the application.

However, if you're building a web server, you should always use the asynchronous version of the file operation to not block the single thread's execution ability to process other user requests.

In your work as a developer at TailWind Traders, you'll need to understand the difference between synchronous and asynchronous operations and when to use each.
