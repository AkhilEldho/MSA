Understand the project structure
Our core setup has two main folders that store code:

public
-Contains any HTML, CSS, images, or other static files
-Stores our index.html and index.css files

src
-Contains any files that need to be rendered
-Stores all .jsx files

We'll also create two files to configure our application:
-package.json: Contains the list of packages and scripts for our application
-snowpack.config.js: Contains configuration options for Snowpack
-We need three main packages for our application:

Snowpack: Used to render JSX to HTML and JavaScript
React: Used to create our components
React-DOM: Used to mount our application
