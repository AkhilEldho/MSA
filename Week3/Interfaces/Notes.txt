INTERFACE

interface Employee {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    fullName(): string;
}

an interface's job is to describe a type of object

-example
let employee: Employee = {
    firstName : "Emil",
    lastName: "Andersson",
    fullName(): string {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
    }
}

TYPE
type is similar to interface but key difference being it cannot be reopened to add new values.
whereas interface it's extendable

Required	All properties are required.	firstName: string;
Optional	Add a question mark (?) to the end of the property name. Use this for properties that are not required.	firstName?: string;
Read only	Use this for properties that should only be modified when an object is first created.	readonly firstName: string;
